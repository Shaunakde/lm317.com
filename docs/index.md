# LM 317

The LM317 is a widely used adjustable voltage regulator integrated circuit (IC) that was developed by Robert C. Dobkin and Robert J. Widlar at National Semiconductor (now part of Texas Instruments). Here is a brief history of the LM317:

Development Phase: The LM317 was introduced in 1972 as a linear voltage regulator IC. It was designed to be an improved and adjustable version of the older LM117, which was a fixed output regulator.

Creators: Robert C. Dobkin and Robert J. Widlar are credited with the development of the LM317. Dobkin was responsible for the architecture and the initial design of the LM317, while Widlar provided crucial insight and guidance during the development process.

Purpose: The LM317 was designed to provide a variable output voltage that could be set by an external resistor network, allowing for flexibility in voltage regulation applications. This made it a versatile choice for various electronic circuits where a stable and adjustable voltage source was needed.

Advantages Over Earlier Regulators: One of the key advantages of the LM317 was its ability to provide a continuous range of output voltages from 1.25 volts up to its maximum rated voltage (usually around 37 volts), making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Popularity and Applications: Due to its versatility, simplicity, and reliability, the LM317 quickly gained popularity among electronics enthusiasts, hobbyists, and professionals alike. It found widespread use in power supplies, battery chargers, audio equipment, and various other electronic devices.

Legacy and Continued Use: Even decades after its introduction, the LM317 remains a popular choice for voltage regulation tasks, particularly in analog circuits. Its simplicity, low cost, and ease of use have contributed to its longevity in the electronics industry.

Manufacturing and Availability: The LM317 has been manufactured by various semiconductor companies over the years, with Texas Instruments (TI) being one of the major producers after their acquisition of National Semiconductor. The IC is widely available from electronics suppliers and is still used extensively in educational, hobbyist, and professional projects.

In summary, the LM317 is an enduring component in electronics design, owing to its innovative design and robust functionality. Its introduction marked a significant advancement in the field of voltage regulation, offering engineers and hobbyists a versatile and efficient solution for a wide range of applications.
